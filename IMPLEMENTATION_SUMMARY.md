# 🔒 Single Device Login System - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

Your FastAPI backend now has a **complete single device login system** that ensures users can only be logged in on one device at a time. Here's what was added:

## ✅ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Single Device Enforcement**
- When a user logs in on a new device, **all previous sessions are automatically invalidated**
- Only **one active session per user** is allowed at any time
- Works for both regular users and super admins

### 2. **Session Tracking & Management**
- New `UserSession` database table tracks all login sessions
- Stores device info, IP address, login time, and last activity
- Session IDs are embedded in JWT tokens for validation

### 3. **Enhanced Authentication**
- JWT tokens now include `session_id` for server-side validation
- Every API request validates both JWT token AND session validity
- Invalid or expired sessions return 401 Unauthorized

### 4. **New API Endpoints**

#### Authentication Endpoints:
- `POST /logout` - Logout current user
- `POST /logout-all-devices` - Logout from all devices  
- `GET /active-sessions` - View all active sessions
- `DELETE /session/{session_id}` - Terminate specific session

#### Super Admin Endpoints:
- `POST /super-admin/logout` - Logout current super admin

## 🔧 Files Modified

### Database Models (`app/models.py`)
- ✅ Added `UserSession` model for session tracking

### Authentication System (`app/auth.py`)
- ✅ Enhanced `create_access_token()` to include session_id
- ✅ Updated `get_current_user()` to validate sessions
- ✅ Updated `get_current_super_admin()` to validate sessions
- ✅ Added session management functions:
  - `create_user_session()` - Creates new session, invalidates old ones
  - `invalidate_user_session()` - Invalidates specific session
  - `is_session_valid()` - Checks session validity

### Login Endpoints (`app/routers/auth_routes.py`)
- ✅ Updated `/login` endpoint to create sessions
- ✅ Added logout and session management endpoints
- ✅ Enhanced login response with session information

### Super Admin Routes (`app/routers/super_admin_routes.py`)
- ✅ Updated `/super-admin/login` to use session system
- ✅ Added `/super-admin/logout` endpoint

### Response Schemas (`app/schemas.py`)
- ✅ Added session-related response models

## 📊 Database Schema Changes

New table created: `user_sessions`
```sql
id              - Primary key
session_id      - Unique session identifier (UUID)
user_id         - Foreign key to users table
device_info     - User agent/device information
ip_address      - IP address of the session
is_active       - Boolean flag for active sessions
created_at      - Session creation timestamp
last_activity   - Last activity timestamp
expires_at      - Session expiration timestamp
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Login Flow:
1. User submits login credentials
2. System validates credentials
3. **All existing sessions for this user are invalidated**
4. New session is created with unique session_id
5. JWT token is generated including the session_id
6. User receives token + session information

### API Request Flow:
1. Client sends request with JWT token
2. System validates JWT token structure and signature
3. **System validates session_id exists and is active**
4. If session is invalid → 401 Unauthorized
5. If session is valid → Request proceeds
6. Last activity timestamp is updated

### Logout Flow:
1. User calls logout endpoint
2. Session_id is extracted from JWT token
3. Session is marked as inactive in database
4. Subsequent requests with that token will fail

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
python migrate_add_sessions.py
```

### 2. Restart FastAPI Server
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### 3. Test Implementation
```bash
python test_single_device_login.py
```

## 💡 User Experience

### Before Implementation:
- Users could be logged in on multiple devices simultaneously
- No way to invalidate sessions server-side
- JWT tokens remained valid until expiry regardless of new logins

### After Implementation:
- ✅ **Only one device login per user**
- ✅ **Clear messaging**: "Login successful. Previous sessions have been logged out."
- ✅ **Session visibility**: Users can see active sessions
- ✅ **Manual logout**: Users can logout from current or all devices
- ✅ **Automatic invalidation**: New login kicks out old sessions

## 🔐 Security Benefits

1. **Prevents unauthorized access** from old/lost devices
2. **Session tracking** for security monitoring
3. **Manual session termination** capabilities
4. **IP and device tracking** for audit purposes
5. **Automatic session cleanup** on new logins

## 📝 API Examples

### Login (Invalidates Previous Sessions)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/login" \
  -d "username=user@example.com&password=password"

# Response includes session_id and warning message
{
  "message": "Login successful. Previous sessions have been logged out.",
  "access_token": "eyJ...",
  "session_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
}
```

### Check Active Sessions  
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8000/active-sessions"

# Shows only current session (max 1 per user)
{
  "active_sessions_count": 1,
  "sessions": [...]
}
```

### Logout
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8000/logout"

# Token becomes invalid after this call
```

## ✨ Summary

Your FastAPI backend now enforces **true single device login** with:
- ✅ Automatic session invalidation on new login
- ✅ Server-side session validation
- ✅ Complete session management API
- ✅ Enhanced security and user control
- ✅ Full audit trail of sessions

Users can no longer stay logged in on multiple devices - each new login automatically logs them out from all other devices, ensuring maximum security and control.
